# RedvsBlue 
Full Red vs Blue activity performing both penetraition testing and security monitoring. 

The activities here are meant to replicate a Red vs Blue engagement. As small group we initally played the role of a blackhat hacker gaining unauthorized access to a company web server and utilizing a PHP reverse shell to establish a Meterpreter session allowing for exfiltration of company data. We then performed the rolle of a Blue Team analyzing the Kibana logs summarize the incident before making system hardening recommendations. By performing all of the roles, this exercise gave us good insight into both offensive and defensive roles.
